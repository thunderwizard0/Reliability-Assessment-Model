### Abstract
This document proposes a three-stage reliability optimization scheme for hybrid AC/DC distribution networks to minimize load shedding during N-1 contingencies. The scheme leverages the operational flexibility of voltage source converters (VSCs) and inverter-based distributed generators (IBDGs).

### Key Features
- Fault isolation modeling
- Microgrid reconfiguration
- System recovery optimization
- Modified fictitious source bus concept
- Radial topology constraints
